Now for an example of the generalization, where some vertices do affect
themselves and some don’t, we can have squares with green and red lamps;
the green lamps affect themselves and also those around them, but the red
lamps only affect those around them and not themselves. Starting with all
lamps off, the goal is to turn on all the green lamps and turn off all the
red ones, and by the corollary this can always be achieved. Of course, the
amount of such scenarios is limited only by the imagination.

In a village there are 100 people. Some of them are friends. The
friendship is mutual (if Avi is a friend of Beni, Beni is a friend of Avi)
but not transitive (if Avi is a friend of Beni, and Beni is a friend of Gadi,
Gadi might be not a friend of Avi). Once a while, one of the people may
decide to start a new life: he stops being friends with all his current
friends, and becomes a friend of all others. Such events may happen
several times.
Can the villagers behave in such a way, so that no matter what was the
original situation, in the end:
(a) At least 50.5% of all pairs of people will be friends?
(b)At least 51% of all pairs of people will be friends?

5*. Show that in a group of 50 people there are two that have an even number of
common friends (maybe 0), assuming that friendship is symmetric.
First solution. Assume there’s someone (denote him Yossi) who has an odd
number of friend. Consider the subgroup of friends of Yossi. If there’s anyone with
even number of friends inside that subgroup, we got someone who actually has
even number of friends with Yossi, QED.
If not, then we have that between odd number of people, each having odd number
of friends in that group, so total number of pairs “someone and his friend” is odd,
but it cannot be since it is equal to twice the number of friendships in that group.
So, it remains to consider the case where each person among the 50 has even
number of friends. Then consider someone called Kobi. The rest of the crowd can
be divided into two parts: even number of the friends of Kobi, denote them F, and
odd number of the others, that group will be denoted as O.
If someone in has even number of friends in then he has an even number of the
common friends with Kobi and we are done. So, it remains to assume that each �
person in has an odd number of friends in F. In particular, each person in F has
even number of friends: odd number in F, Kobi himself, and even number from O.
So the number of friendships between F and O is even number of even numbers,
and that is even.
On the other hand, each person in O has odd number of friends in F, and O is of
odd order, so the number of friendships between F and O is an odd number of odd
numbers, and that is odd.
That is a contradiction: the number of friendship connections between O and F is
both even and odd.

Journal/todo app that asks me what I'll do and what I did. I've emulated having a todo app that every morning/night asks me: "what will you do?" and I can fill in a handful of items. But it also shows me the items from the last time and asks "did you do them?", giving me the option to check them off, throw them out, or move them to the next day.
