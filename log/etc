Now for an example of the generalization, where some vertices do affect
themselves and some donâ€™t, we can have squares with green and red lamps;
the green lamps affect themselves and also those around them, but the red
lamps only affect those around them and not themselves. Starting with all
lamps off, the goal is to turn on all the green lamps and turn off all the
red ones, and by the corollary this can always be achieved. Of course, the
amount of such scenarios is limited only by the imagination.
